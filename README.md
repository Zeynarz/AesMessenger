# AES Messenger
## Description
**Project is still under construction and can't be used yet.**      
**This messenger is implemented in C, so please contact me if you find any memory corruption vulnerabilities**    
Connect to other computers to talk to other people.All of the messages sent are encrypted with aes with the key of your own.The computers communicating all need to know the aes key in order to encrypt and decrypt messages correctly. Even if other people somehow got your message, they won't be able to decrpyt it without the correct aes key.You can either message one person at a time, or join a room to communicate with several person at a time.  
**Note**: Please keep in mind that this is only a project for me to learn more about aes and networking , and try to implement it in C.(so I can get more fluent in C as well). This program very likely has some flaws,so if there are any errors,please tell me.
